The dry bursts of the machine-guns rattle; above us the air teems with invisible swift movement, with howls, pipings, and hisses. They are smaller shells; and amongst them, booming through the night like an organ, go the great coal-boxes and the heavies. They have a hoarse, distant bellow like a rutting stag and make their way high above the howl and whistle of the smaller shells. It reminds me of flocks of wild geese when I hear them. Last autumn the wild geese flew day after day across the path of the shells. The searchlights begin to sweep the dark sky. They slide along it like gigantic tapering rulers. One of them pauses, and quivers a little. Immediately a second is beside it; a black insect is caught between them and tries to escape - the airman. He hesitates, is blinded and falls.",
